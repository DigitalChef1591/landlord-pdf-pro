## âœ… Completed
- [x] Fixed Stripe and Supabase build-time initialization errors
- [x] Successfully deployed to Vercel
- [x] Added Supabase environment variables correctly
- [x] App should now be live and functional

## ðŸš€ Your Live App
Your Landlord PDF Pro app should now be live at your Vercel URL. The basic functionality including demo mode should work.

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps to Complete Full Functionality

### 1. Add Stripe Environment Variables
To enable payments, add these to Vercel â†’ Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables:

**Required Stripe Variables:**
- **Key**: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- **Value**: `sk_test_...` (from your Stripe Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ API Keys)

- **Key**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` 
- **Value**: `pk_test_...` (from your Stripe Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ API Keys)

- **Key**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID`
- **Value**: `price_...` (create a $29 one-time product in Stripe Dashboard â†’ Products)

### 2. Create Stripe Product & Price
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Products
2. Click "Add product"
3. Name: "Landlord PDF Pro"
4. Pricing: One-time payment, $29.00 USD
5. Copy the Price ID (starts with `price_...`)
6. Add this as `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID` in Vercel

### 3. Set Up Stripe Webhook
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Endpoint URL: `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook`
4. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`
5. Copy the webhook secret (starts with `whsec_...`)
6. Add as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel

### 4. Test Your Live App
Once Stripe is configured:
- âœ… Visit your live URL
- âœ… Test demo functionality (should show watermark)
- âœ… Test "Buy Now" button (should redirect to Stripe Checkout)
- âœ… Complete a test purchase
- âœ… Verify paid users can export clean PDFs

## ðŸ”§ Supabase Database Setup
If you haven't already, run the database schema:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `SUPABASE_SCHEMA_FIXED.sql`
3. Click "Run" to create all tables and policies

## ðŸ“± Mobile App (Optional)
Your Expo React Native app is ready for deployment:
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Build for iOS and Android
cd apps/mobile
eas build --platform all
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics
Your app is production-ready when:
- âœ… Landing page loads without errors
- âœ… Demo export generates watermarked PDF
- âœ… Stripe checkout completes successfully
- âœ… Paid users can export unlimited clean PDFs
- âœ… User authentication works
- âœ… PDF generation is fast (<10 seconds)
