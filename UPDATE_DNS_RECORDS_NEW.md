# ðŸš¨ UPDATE: Vercel Changed DNS Requirements

## What Happened
Vercel updated their IP addresses and is now showing different DNS records than what we set up in GoDaddy.

## Current Vercel Requirements (from screenshot):

### For Root Domain (landlordpdfpro.net):
- **Type**: A
- **Name**: @
- **Value**: `216.198.79.1` (NEW IP - different from before!)

### For WWW (www.landlordpdfpro.net):
- **Type**: CNAME
- **Name**: www
- **Value**: `ed08573f377bfdc.vercel-dns-017.com` (NEW VALUE!)

## ðŸ”§ URGENT: Update GoDaddy DNS Records

### Step 1: Go to GoDaddy DNS Management
1. Go to GoDaddy.com â†’ My Products â†’ landlordpdfpro.net â†’ DNS

### Step 2: Update the A Record
1. Find the A record with Name: @
2. Change the Value from `76.76.19.61` to `216.198.79.1`
3. Save

### Step 3: Update the CNAME Record
1. Find the CNAME record with Name: www
2. Change the Value from `cname.vercel-dns.com` to `ed08573f377bfdc.vercel-dns-017.com`
3. Save

### Step 4: Wait for Propagation
- DNS changes take 5-30 minutes to propagate
- Your domain will work once these new records are active

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Happened
Vercel mentioned "planned IP range expansion" - they're updating their infrastructure and gave you new, more specific DNS records for better performance.

## âœ… After Updating
Your domain `https://landlordpdfpro.net` will work perfectly with these new DNS records.
