# FORCE VERCEL REDEPLOY

This file forces Vercel to pick up the latest commit with the Next.js 15 fix.

Current commit: 3d7c639 (contains the fix)
Vercel was building: 7513a12 (old commit without fix)

The fix changes:
```typescript
// OLD (broken)
{ params }: { params: { inspectionId: string } }

// NEW (fixed) 
{ params }: { params: Promise<{ inspectionId: string }> }
const { inspectionId } = await params;
```

This should trigger a fresh deployment with the correct commit.
