# 🎯 Stripe Webhook Setup - Step 2

## ✅ Great Progress!
I can see you're now in the "Create an event destination" form. Perfect!

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Select Account Type
- Keep **"Your account"** selected (the purple highlighted option)
- This is correct for receiving events from your own Stripe account

### 2. API Version
- Keep **"2025-08-27.basil"** selected
- This matches what we configured in the code

### 3. Click "Continue"
Click the purple **"Continue →"** button at the bottom right

## 🔄 What Happens Next
After clicking Continue, you'll see:
1. A form to enter your webhook endpoint URL
2. Event selection options
3. Webhook configuration settings

## 🌐 Your Webhook URL
When you get to the URL field, you'll need your Vercel deployment URL. It should look like:
```
https://your-app-name-hash.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook
```

## 🔍 Finding Your Vercel URL
If you don't know your Vercel URL:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard (vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your "landlord-pdf-pro" project
3. Click on it to see the deployment URL
4. It will be something like: `https://landlord-pdf-pro-abc123.vercel.app`

## 🚀 Ready for Next Step
Click that **"Continue →"** button and let me know what you see next!
