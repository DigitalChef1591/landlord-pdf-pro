# ðŸŽ‰ STRIPE CHECKOUT ISSUE RESOLVED!

## âœ… **PROBLEM FIXED**

**The Issue:**
- You were getting "Something went wrong - The page you were looking for could not be found" on checkout.stripe.com
- The Buy Now button was redirecting to an incorrect Stripe URL format

**Root Cause:**
- The purchase page was constructing a manual URL: `https://checkout.stripe.com/pay/${sessionId}`
- This URL format doesn't exist in Stripe's system
- Stripe provides the correct checkout URL in the session object

## ðŸ”§ **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### 1. Updated API Route (`apps/web/app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`)
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only returned sessionId
return NextResponse.json({ sessionId: session.id })

// AFTER: Now returns both sessionId AND the official URL
return NextResponse.json({ 
  sessionId: session.id,
  url: session.url 
})
```

### 2. Updated Purchase Page (`apps/web/app/purchase/page.tsx`)
```javascript
// BEFORE: Manual URL construction (WRONG)
if (data.sessionId) {
  window.location.href = `https://checkout.stripe.com/pay/${data.sessionId}`;
}

// AFTER: Use official Stripe URL (CORRECT)
if (data.url) {
  window.location.href = data.url;
}
```

## ðŸš€ **READY TO TEST**

The Buy Now button should now work perfectly! Here's what happens:

1. âœ… User clicks "Buy Now - $29"
2. âœ… Creates checkout session with your Price ID
3. âœ… Gets official Stripe checkout URL from API
4. âœ… Redirects to proper Stripe checkout page
5. âœ… After payment, redirects to `/thank-you` page

## ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Test the Buy Now button** - It should now redirect to a working Stripe checkout page
2. **Complete a test purchase** - Use Stripe's test card numbers
3. **Verify the thank-you page** - Should show after successful payment

## ðŸ’³ **TEST CARD NUMBERS**

For testing Stripe checkout:
- **Success:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Decline:** `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **Any future date for expiry, any 3-digit CVC**
