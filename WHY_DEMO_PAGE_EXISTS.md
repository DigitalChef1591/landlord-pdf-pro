## ðŸ’° BUSINESS STRATEGY:

### Landing Page (`/`) = Sales Page
- **Purpose**: Convert visitors to buyers
- **Content**: Value proposition, pricing, testimonials
- **CTA**: "Buy Now" for $29
- **Target**: Ready-to-buy customers

### Demo Page (`/demo`) = Lead Generation + Ad Revenue
- **Purpose**: Capture hesitant visitors who aren't ready to buy
- **Content**: Full working demo with limitations
- **Revenue**: AdSense ads + upgrade prompts
- **Target**: "Try before you buy" customers

---

## ðŸŽ¯ WHY THIS WORKS:

### Visitor Flow:
1. **Visitor lands** on your site
2. **Not ready to buy?** â†’ Click "Try Demo"
3. **Use the demo** â†’ See ads (revenue stream #1)
4. **Hit limitations** â†’ Upgrade to Pro (revenue stream #2)

### Revenue Optimization:
- **Immediate buyers**: Go straight to purchase ($29)
- **Hesitant visitors**: Generate ad revenue while using demo
- **Demo users**: Convert to paid after seeing value

## ðŸ“Š CONVERSION FUNNEL:

```
100 Visitors
â”œâ”€â”€ 5 buy immediately ($145 revenue)
â”œâ”€â”€ 30 try demo
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Generate $3-15 in ad revenue
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 8 upgrade after demo ($232 revenue)
â””â”€â”€ 65 leave (but saw ads = $2-8 revenue)

Total: $380-400 vs $145 without demo
```

**This is why successful SaaS companies always have free tiers or demos!**
