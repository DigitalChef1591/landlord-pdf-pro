# Demo Page 404 Troubleshooting Status

## Current Situation
- **Main page**: ✅ Working perfectly at https://landlordpdfpro.net
- **Demo page**: ❌ Still showing 404 at https://landlordpdfpro.net/demo
- **Local build**: ✅ Successful - demo page builds correctly locally

## What We've Fixed
1. ✅ **Directory Structure**: Moved demo page to correct `apps/web/src/app/demo/page.tsx`
2. ✅ **Import Paths**: Fixed all alias imports to use relative paths:
   - `@/components/ui/button` → `../../components/ui/button`
   - `@/components/ui/card` → `../../components/ui/card`
   - `@/components/ui/badge` → `../../components/ui/badge`
   - `@/components/ui/ad-banner` → `../../components/ui/ad-banner`
3. ✅ **Build Process**: Local build completes successfully with demo page included
4. ✅ **Code Quality**: All TypeScript compilation errors resolved

## Local Build Results
```
Route (app)                Size     First Load JS
├ ○ /demo                  4.76 kB  120 kB
```
The demo page is being built successfully locally.

## Possible Causes for Continued 404
1. **Vercel Cache Issue**: Vercel might be serving cached version
2. **Deployment Delay**: Build might still be in progress
3. **Vercel Configuration**: There might be a routing issue in Vercel
4. **Environment Variables**: Missing env vars might cause build to fail on Vercel

## Next Steps to Try
1. **Wait for Deployment**: Give Vercel more time to complete deployment
2. **Clear Vercel Cache**: In Vercel dashboard, trigger a new deployment
3. **Check Vercel Build Logs**: Look for any deployment errors in Vercel dashboard
4. **Force Redeploy**: Make a small commit to trigger fresh deployment
5. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set in Vercel

## Files Successfully Updated
- `apps/web/src/app/demo/page.tsx` - All imports fixed
- `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout exists
- `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` - Main page exists

## Technical Details
- Next.js 15.5.0 App Router structure
- TypeScript compilation successful
- All UI components properly imported
- AdSense integration ready
- Demo functionality complete with proper limitations

The code is correct and builds successfully. The issue appears to be with Vercel deployment/caching rather than the code itself.
