# Buy Now Button Fix - Status Update

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

The "Buy Now" button issue has been **FIXED**! 

### What was the problem?
- The purchase page was trying to use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID` on the client side
- Stripe environment variables weren't configured in production
- No proper error handling when Stripe wasn't set up

### What was fixed?
1. **✅ Removed client-side dependency** on Stripe environment variables
2. **✅ Added proper error handling** in the purchase flow
3. **✅ Added graceful fallback** when Stripe isn't configured
4. **✅ Improved user experience** with clear error messages

### Current Status:
- **Buy Now button now works** - it will show a proper error message instead of doing nothing
- **Error message**: "Payment system is currently being set up. Please check back soon!"
- **User experience**: Button shows "Processing..." state and then displays helpful message

## Next Steps to Enable Full Payment Processing

To make the Buy Now button fully functional with actual Stripe payments, you need to:

### 1. Set up Stripe Account
1. Go to https://stripe.com and create an account
2. Get your API keys from the Stripe Dashboard

### 2. Add Environment Variables to Vercel
In your Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... (or sk_test_... for testing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_... (or pk_test_... for testing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_... (create a product in Stripe first)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (after setting up webhook)
```

### 3. Create Product in Stripe
1. In Stripe Dashboard → Products
2. Create "Landlord PDF Pro" product for $29
3. Copy the Price ID to use in `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID`

### 4. Set up Webhook
1. In Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://landlordpdfpro.net/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Current User Experience

**Before Fix**: Button did nothing, no feedback
**After Fix**: Button shows processing state and helpful message

Once Stripe is configured, the button will redirect users to Stripe Checkout for payment processing.
