## 📋 VERIFICATION STEPS

### Option A: Try AdSense Code Verification
1. Go to your AdSense dashboard
2. Select "AdSense code snippet" method
3. Click "Verify" (the code is already on your site)
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for Google to crawl your site

### Option B: Try Meta Tag Verification
1. In AdSense dashboard, select "Meta tag" method
2. Look for this meta tag (it's already on your site):
   ```html
   <meta name="google-adsense-account" content="ca-pub-3590755249240804">
   ```
3. Click "Verify"

### Option C: Try ads.txt Verification

2. Your ads.txt file is already live at: https://landlordpdfpro.net/ads.txt
3. Click "Verify"

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Verification Still Fails:

#### 1. Wait Longer

#### 2. Check Site Accessibility
- Ensure https://landlordpdfpro.net loads properly
- Check that there are no robots.txt blocks

#### 3. Try Different Browser
