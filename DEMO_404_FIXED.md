# ðŸŽ‰ DEMO PAGE 404 FIXED!

## âœ… PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND SOLVED:

### The Issue:
- Demo page existed in **wrong directory**: `apps/web/app/demo/page.tsx`
- Vercel was building from **correct directory**: `apps/web/src/app/`
- Result: 404 error because demo page wasn't in the build

### The Solution:
1. âœ… Created `apps/web/src/app/demo/` directory
2. âœ… Copied demo page to correct location: `apps/web/src/app/demo/page.tsx`
3. âœ… Committed and pushed changes
4. âœ… Vercel is now redeploying with the fix
