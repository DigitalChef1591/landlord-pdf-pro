# ðŸŽ¯ WHICH A RECORD TO UPDATE - CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS

## What I See in Your Screenshot:
You have 2 A records, both with Name: **@**

1. **A Record 1**: @ â†’ `15.197.142.173` (TTL: 600 seconds)
2. **A Record 2**: @ â†’ `3.33.152.147` (TTL: 600 seconds)

## ðŸš¨ SOLUTION: Update BOTH A Records

### Why Both?
You have duplicate A records pointing to different IPs. We need to consolidate them into ONE record with the new Vercel IP.

### STEP-BY-STEP:

#### Step 1: Delete One A Record
1. **Delete the SECOND A record** (the one with `3.33.152.147`)
2. Click the **Delete** button for that row
3. Confirm deletion

#### Step 2: Update the Remaining A Record
1. **Edit the FIRST A record** (the one with `15.197.142.173`)
2. Change the Data/Value from `15.197.142.173` to: **`216.198.79.1`**
3. Save the changes

#### Step 3: Final Result
After these changes, you should have:
```
Type    Name    Data
A       @       216.198.79.1
CNAME   www     ed08573f377bfdc.vercel-dns-017.com
```

## ðŸ”§ EXACT ACTIONS:

1. **DELETE**: A record with `3.33.152.147`
2. **EDIT**: A record with `15.197.142.173` â†’ change to `216.198.79.1`
3. **UPDATE**: CNAME record (www) to `ed08573f377bfdc.vercel-dns-017.com`

---

## âœ… Why This Works:
- Multiple A records cause conflicts
- Vercel needs exactly ONE A record pointing to their new IP
- This will make your domain work perfectly

**ACTION**: Delete one A record, update the other to the new Vercel IP!
