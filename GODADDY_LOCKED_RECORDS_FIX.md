# ðŸš¨ GoDaddy Won't Let You Edit/Delete A Records - SOLUTION

## Why This Happens:
GoDaddy sometimes locks DNS records when:
- Domain is connected to their Website Builder
- Domain has "Domain Protection" enabled
- Records are managed by another service

## ðŸ”§ SOLUTIONS TO TRY:

### Solution 1: Check Domain Lock Status
1. In GoDaddy, go to **My Products** â†’ **landlordpdfpro.net**
2. Look for **Domain Lock** or **Transfer Lock**
3. If enabled, **temporarily disable** it
4. Try editing DNS records again

### Solution 2: Check Website Builder
1. In GoDaddy, look for **Website Builder** or **GoCentral**
2. If your domain is connected to Website Builder:
   - **Disconnect** it temporarily
   - Go back to DNS management
   - Edit the records

### Solution 3: Use Advanced DNS (Recommended)
1. In GoDaddy DNS management, look for **"Advanced"** or **"Expert Mode"**
2. Click to switch to advanced view
3. This often unlocks editing capabilities

### Solution 4: Contact GoDaddy Support
If none work:
1. Call GoDaddy: **1-480-505-8877**
2. Say: "I need to edit my DNS A records for Vercel deployment"
3. They can unlock the records instantly

## ðŸŽ¯ ALTERNATIVE: Add New Records Instead

If you still can't edit, try this:

### Step 1: Add New A Record
1. Click **"Add Record"** or **"+"**
2. Type: **A**
3. Name: **@**
4. Value: **216.198.79.1**
5. TTL: **600**
6. Save

### Step 2: Add/Update CNAME
1. Add or edit CNAME record
2. Name: **www**
3. Value: **ed08573f377bfdc.vercel-dns-017.com**
4. Save

### Step 3: Wait for Propagation
- The new records will override the old ones
